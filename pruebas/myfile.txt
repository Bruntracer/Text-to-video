Amazing set of headphones! I love the multi-device bluetooth functionally! I've connect them to my Windows PC, Macbook Pro, and my iPhone flawlessly! The sound quality is excellent, with clean highs and deep base. Pretty good for a set of headphone! They're amazingly comfortable with their around-ear design too. Also, and I didn't think I'd love this feature as much as I do, the "LifeMix" feature is amazing! Finally I can sit at my desk next to my wife watching YouTube/Netflix and also hear her if she asks me a question! The included charging dock is also great! All in all a great set of headphones!
